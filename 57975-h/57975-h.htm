<p class="reptitle">EXCAVATING<br />
A HUSBAND</p>


<p>Katherine Boulby had reached her fiftieth year,
and all these years had been spent in single blessedness.
It is true that she had not realized the
entirety of the perfect calm and peace that
abides in the maiden state, for her brother
Joseph and she lived together. But Miss Katherine&mdash;as
she was commonly called in her native
town&mdash;was of a cheerful disposition and
said that she felt she was indeed blessed
among women, as she had graciously been
endowed with sense enough to choose a free
and unfettered life, and the vexations and limitations
contingent upon the proximity of one of the
male sex, had been mitigated as much as possible
for her as her brother was a quiet, fairly pliant
man who rarely interfered with her plans for
broadening and enriching her mind.</p>

<p>This mental culture was Miss Katherine&rsquo;s chief
aim in life, and it was not a selfish one. She never
refused to give abundantly of her knowledge, and
ever strove to correct and purify the literary and
artistic tastes of her friends. It would be quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
impossible to state upon what lines Miss Katherine
pursued her mental cultivation, for, like the great
geniuses, she was extremely versatile, and in almost
every subject she described an avenue which,
if followed to the end would lead at last to the
goal whither she was bound. As Miss Katherine
strayed from one path to another in the great labyrinth
of learning, it is very probable that she was
inextricably lost and didn&rsquo;t know it. But she
found pleasure and sustenance therein, and never
sought to find herself.</p>

<p>Now, it is far from my purpose to represent my
heroine as a blue-stocking or as other than a most
charming person. Had she pursued her studies
methodically and scientifically she might not have
been the same delightful woman that she was, but
she flitted from romantic prose to didactic poetry
and from poetry to astrology, and thence to architecture,
history or biology. In Miss Katherine
you found a person who possessed a rare instinct
concerning hobbies. She never became so abstruse
as to be unintelligible to her friends who
were not hobbyists. She dealt in interesting and
easy generalities.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Katherine was one of a type the
world cannot spare. Of good, sound, common
sense she possessed the usual allotment, but in
rare, child-like enthusiasm and love of romance
she was richly endowed. It is true that at times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
everything but romantic fancies seemed expelled
from her mind, but the complications thus arising
were of no moment when all the brightness and
zest she infused into life were considered. It was
psychologically impossible for Miss Katherine to
view the commonplace occurrences of everyday
life in the same light as do most of us. She found
in a very ordinary event the nucleus of something
interesting and romantic. So you see there was
nothing of the blue-stocking about my heroine.</p>

<p>There is another matter upon which the reader
must be clear. One might think from Miss Katherine&rsquo;s
fervent thankfulness for her single state
that she had an aversion to men. Such was the
case only in theory. It seemed more fitting for
a single woman of artistic temperament to avow
a distaste for the society of the coarser sex, but in
reality she got along rather better with men than
women. As a rule, men are better listeners than
women, and Miss Katherine found them more disposed
to listen to her latest ideas and freshest aspirations
than were women. She did not credit
these listeners with ability to understand all she
was saying and this incapacity in man was the
reason she had never married. She had a susceptible
heart, but it would respond only to him
who would understand her. She was not at all
averse to marriage and kept a vigilant eye upon
the horizon that she might catch the first possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
glimpse of the romantic figure she confidently expected
would one day loom thereon. His appearance
was long delayed, and, while Miss Katherine
did not mourn because of this, still she wisely considered
moving to where she would view a new
and broader horizon.</p>

<p>One day she came upon the following advertisement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Rent&mdash;Furnished house, property of Captain
Peter Shannon; delightful situation, attractive
and comfortable house; garden contains very
choice plants and shrubs. Apply, W.&nbsp;J. Skinner,
Ocean View.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Katherine to her
brother, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it delightful to find just what we
want with so little trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it&rsquo;s just what we want?&rdquo;
asked Joseph, who had partially consented to his
sister&rsquo;s suggestion that they rent a house near
the sea during the spring and summer.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine did not possess any occult power
by which she could visualize the property advertised,
but she did have a remarkable faculty for
reading between lines. It often happened that
she found there that which defied every other interpretation,
but this was possibly owing to her
highly developed imagination. She had so often
urged her brother to develop this quality, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
now his utter lack of imagination made her reply
crisply&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know? Because my mind has certain
qualities that I see yours will never possess,
and besides I think a little. Now consider this advertisement
with the aid of a very little imagination
and common sense. The owner is a sea
captain. That is a volume in itself to me. Sailors
are very fond of the picturesque, so I should expect
Captain Shannon&rsquo;s house to be delightfully
situated, quaint and comfortable. I can&rsquo;t imagine
anyone from whom I&rsquo;d rather buy property than
from such a man as Captain Shannon must be,&rdquo;
concluded Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he live in it himself, then, if it&rsquo;s
such a fine place?&rdquo; inquired Joseph with an attempt
at sarcasm which was quite beyond him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he live in a house on the land and sail on
the sea at the same time?&rdquo; demanded his disgusted
sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I had such a place as you say it is I
wouldn&rsquo;t be risking my neck on the sea. I&rsquo;d stay
right there and raise vegetables,&rdquo; returned Joseph.</p>

<p>Joseph was several years older than his sister
and as he had just retired from business with the
intention of spending the remainder of his days in
peace and calm, he thought it wise not to jeopardize
this residue of his life by running counter to
any fixed idea of his sister. But in yielding to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
Miss Katherine&rsquo;s strong desire to spend the spring
and summer near the sea, Joseph was not solely
actuated by fear of her displeasure. He thought
that a few months of undisturbed gardening would
be the purest possible happiness, so readily consented
to Miss Katherine&rsquo;s going to view the place
for rent. She went, she saw and she was captivated.
Such a view! Such a garden! Nothing
could be more delightful.</p>

<p>Ocean View was not far distant from their
home, so the day after his sister&rsquo;s return Joseph
set out to see the house for himself. He found
Miss Katherine&rsquo;s praise very just. It was indeed
a most pleasant place, and though the garden
sadly needed care, that fact, in Joseph&rsquo;s eyes, did
not detract from the desirability of the place.
Beneath a very impassive exterior he concealed a
tenderness and real passion for flowers and a garden.
He had passed his days in his hardware shop
among unlovely objects, and had never gratified
this one passion, which was still strong. But now
Joseph thought of the long spring and summer
days spent in the garden, and went in haste to interview
the agent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Shannon&rsquo;s place, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Skinner.
&ldquo;It used to be a pretty place when the Captain
lived there, and I have had good tenants who
have kept it up pretty well, but we didn&rsquo;t rent it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
last year so it&rsquo;s grown up rather wild. Would
you happen to be fond of flowers, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon Joseph&rsquo;s replying that he was, Mr. Skinner
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Shannon lived there only two years
when he took to sea again. I don&rsquo;t know
whether he&rsquo;s dead or alive, for that&rsquo;s seven
years ago, and I&rsquo;ve never seen or heard from
him since. I send the rent to his bank in New
York, but it&rsquo;s my opinion that he&rsquo;s gone
where he don&rsquo;t need money, for if he was alive
why wouldn&rsquo;t he come back and spend the rest of
his days here? He ain&rsquo;t a young man by any
means, about sixty, I think. But I was going to
tell you why I asked if you were fond of flowers.
The Captain was crazy about them and kept a
record of all his choice plants. That book&rsquo;s in the
library now. Well, when he told me he was going
to sea again and asked to rent the place, he said
to get a tenant that would look after the plants.
It just seemed to me he wanted to stay, but the
sea pulled too strong for him and he had to go.
But now if you like pottering round in a garden,
that&rsquo;s just the place for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph felt it was but did not express himself
too strongly until he had concluded a very good
bargain.</p>

<p>To Miss Katherine&rsquo;s extreme delight Joseph
was ready to move to Ocean View without delay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
She had drawn from him all the information concerning
Captain Shannon that he had obtained
from Mr. Skinner. She had immediately jumped
to the conclusion that the Captain had been lost
at sea. To tell the truth, although she had as tender
a heart as woman ever possessed, the owner&rsquo;s
tragic end rather increased her delight in her surroundings.
It wasn&rsquo;t every day one had the opportunity
of handling things that had belonged to
one for whom fate had destined such a tragic end.</p>

<p>It was towards the books in the library that she
felt most reverently. Not for a moment could she
forget that these books had been selected, read
and loved by Captain Peter Shannon, victim of
the cavernous seas. But soon she came to value
the books for themselves, for she found them
much to her taste. There was nothing in literature
that so captivated Miss Katherine as tales
of daring on land or sea, and of these the Captain&rsquo;s
library was full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Shannon must have been a very interesting
man,&rdquo; she remarked rather sadly to Joseph.
&ldquo;I can tell by his books. His tastes were
just like mine,&rdquo; she added naively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your mind run on him too much,
Katie,&rdquo; advised Joseph. &ldquo;It would only lead to
disappointment, for he&rsquo;s most likely drowned or
dead, it don&rsquo;t matter which.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try to exercise a little common sense, Joseph
Boulby,&rdquo; returned his sister acidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; asked Joseph. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything
unreasonable about warning you not to set
your heart upon a dead man. There&rsquo;s not much
chance of a corpse coming to life these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph&rsquo;s delight in his garden was actually making
him facetious.</p>

<p>However strongly Miss Katherine became convinced
that, had he lived, there would have been a
strong affinity and perhaps something more between
Captain Shannon and herself, she did not
become depressed. But without doubt there entered
into Miss Katherine&rsquo;s heart a sentiment that
she had never experienced before.</p>

<p>In a closet full of rubbish she found a portrait
of a seamanly looking, heavily whiskered man.
This she rightly conjectured to be a feeble attempt
to reproduce on canvas Captain Shannon&rsquo;s noble
countenance. She tastefully framed the portrait
and hung it over the books she fancied he had best
loved.</p>

<p>Having made an exhaustive examination of the
books on the library shelves, Miss Katherine
turned her attention to the papers which the
table and desk contained. She felt no compunction
in doing this, although she rarely meddled
with the affairs of others. But to Captain Shannon&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
personal papers she felt she had a peculiar
right, a sort of spiritual right.</p>

<p>What she found among these papers was of such
interest and import that she rushed at once to
find her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph! Joseph Boulby!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
never guess what I&rsquo;ve found! The log of a
schooner! Captain Shannon&rsquo;s schooner. He was
shipwrecked and the schooner was lost but&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
read it to you, Joseph: &lsquo;Log of Schooner Fare-thee-well&rsquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
that a fine name&mdash;&lsquo;Peter Shannon
owner and master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 17, &rsquo;05.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sailed from Manzanilla with cargo of lumber
for Panama. Wind blowing strong from N.&nbsp;W.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Made 105 miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 18.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wind increased in volume. Still running with
wind on starboard beam. Unable to make an observation.
Made 190 miles by dead reckoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 19.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wind veered slightly to westward and continued
to freshen. Glass falling rapidly. Made
204 miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Above is log of schooner up to May 20, from
which time it was impossible to keep further
record until she was beached. Following is story
of the last voyage of the Fare-thee-well. It was
written after landing on Cocos Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;May 20. Hurricane struck us at four bells in
the afternoon watch, as nearly as I can remember.
Called all hands to close reef the mainsail, intending
to run before wind under storm jib and mainsail
reefed down, when enormous sea struck us
washing away mate and two seamen, leaving only
myself and boy. Schooner heeled so far to port
that I feared she could not right herself, and
water covered half the desk. Strain on mainsail
so great that it snapped about fourteen feet above
deck carrying sail and top hamper with it. Boy
and I managed to cut away all stays and shrouds
and cleared away the wreckage, after which we
scuddled before the wind under bare poles. With
help of boy I managed to rig spare topsail from
stump of mainmast and with storm jib we managed
to keep steerage way upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 21. Still running before the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 22. Do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 23. Do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 24. Just before midnight, as near as I can
remember, schooner struck with terrible force
and waves swept her from stem to stem. Boy
carried overboard. Was unable to do anything to
save him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May 25. When morning came the sea had
gone down somewhat and I discovered an island
about one hundred fathoms on port bow. Was
afraid vessel would break up so made a raft with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
what spars and lumber I could get together, and
taking the log book, a few tools, instruments and
provisions, I endeavored to reach the land. After
great difficulty I landed on what proved to be
Cocos Island.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment or two after she had ceased reading,
Miss Katherine remained silent as if overpowered.
She soon recovered speech however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I had estimated Captain Shannon correctly
when I said that he was no ordinary man,
but I don&rsquo;t believe I did full justice to him. Did
you notice the style of this narrative, Joseph? It
is so direct and simple, but forceful and compelling.
I don&rsquo;t think I would be going too far to say
that there is the stamp of genius upon this manuscript.
And his modesty, Joseph! Nothing about
his wonderful seamanship that kept the ship afloat
or about the quick wittedness and strength that
saved him, or about his sojourn on the island or
his daring escape from it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose a ship came along and took him off,&rdquo;
said Joseph. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any daring in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t, I do,&rdquo; retorted his sister.
&ldquo;The idea of a man like Captain Shannon waiting
for a ship to take him away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be more sensible to wait a spell
before he started out,&rdquo; observed Joseph.</p>

<p>Tenderly disposed as she was to the memory of
Captain Shannon, Joseph&rsquo;s remark grated upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
Miss Katherine, and she made a very cutting remark
about people who had no fine sensibilities
themselves and could not feel for others who had.
However, she forgave and forgot very quickly, and
the next evening she confided to Joseph a most
important discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember that I read last night that
Captain Shannon had been on Cocos Island?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>Joseph replied that he remembered all she had
read to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Miss Katherine, &ldquo;the name
of that island bothered me all night, and to-day I
set to work to find out what I had heard about it.
This is what I found in the encyclopedia:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cocos Island, volcanic island in the Pacific
Ocean, S.&nbsp;W. of Costa Rica, with steep rugged
coasts and quite level interior; comprises about
nine square miles, is uninhabited and is reported
to have been the place of concealment of treasure,
jewelry and plate sent there by wealthy inhabitants
of Spanish colonies on the neighboring mainland
early in the nineteenth century, during the
wars in which they achieved their independence
from Spain. The belief that many of these valuables
have never been recovered led to a number
of unsuccessful search expeditions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have never been recovered, Joseph,&rdquo; repeated
Miss Katherine with glistening eyes. &ldquo;Did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
you note the significance of that? The treasure
was there when Captain Shannon landed on the
island, and there he was alone on the island, with
provisions enough to enable him to remain there
a considerable time, with tools to aid him in a
complete search, and with a raft to carry him to
the mainland when he had found the object of his
search. What do you think now, Joseph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have had a devil of a time landing on
that island in a raft if the coast is rugged and
steep, as it says,&rdquo; remarked Joseph irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine wanted to shake her brother,
but she brought wile instead of strength to her
aid. Joseph was known among his neighbors to
be &ldquo;a little close.&rdquo; He certainly regarded with respect
and almost reverence whatever represented
a good sum of dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That treasure must have been worth millions
of dollars,&rdquo; began Miss Katherine. &ldquo;Even if Captain
Shannon discovered or brought away only a
small part of it, there would have been great
wealth in that part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he might not have known anything about
it,&rdquo; interposed Joseph, who was becoming interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea!&rdquo; exclaimed his sister, &ldquo;Captain Shannon
not to know all about Cocos Island!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Joseph wasn&rsquo;t to be scorned off well taken
ground, and maintained that the Captain had had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
too much sense to put dependence in such yarns
as that.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine began very patiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a yarn, but a well substantiated fact
that every sea captain would know. But I have
good reasons for believing he found it,&rdquo; concluded
Miss Katherine mysteriously.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine closed her lips tightly as if
she knew a great deal but was resolved to make
no more disclosures to a skeptic. She acted very
wisely, for curiosity is not confined exclusively to
females. Joseph resisted as long as he could and
then said in a gruffly apologetic tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you, Katie; but I was
trying to see all sides of the case. Would you have
any idea where he put the money and valuables, if
he found them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine was quite mollified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to say that I knew exactly
where he put them, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve deduced
from the facts of the case. One would suppose
that Captain Shannon had put all his money
into his schooner which was lost, but notwithstanding
that he immediately settles here and
spends a good deal of money upon this property.
I am convinced that that money was part of the
treasure he found on Cocos Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine paused impressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where is the rest?&rdquo; asked her brother in almost
child-like faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fate destined the Captain to be a victim of the
sea, so he had to leave, and he thought to himself
that he wanted his treasure to fall into the hands
of some kindred spirit, should he never return.
Captain Shannon is a man whom few understand,
but I am convinced that I do. He was a
man of strong human sympathy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Katie, dear,&rdquo; interrupted Joseph meekly.
&ldquo;What you say is perfectly correct, but what were
you going to say about the treasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just about to explain it all, Joseph. He
wanted his treasure to fall into the hands of some
kindred spirit, should he never return, some one
who would be able to deduce his idea from the
clews he left behind. First he leaves instructions
that only congenial people are to rent this
property, then he leaves his diary. Then he says to
himself, &lsquo;If the person that reads this diary is
really interested in me, that person will find out
the history of Cocos Island and infer my discovery
of the treasure.&rsquo; And then he thought it would
be but a short step to the actual finding of the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Joseph. &ldquo;A short step? In
what direction I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not prepared to say exactly where it is,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
explained Miss Katherine, &ldquo;but my theory is that
it is secreted about the house or garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s in that garden,&rdquo; began Joseph, energetically
but was interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be very guarded and no one must
suspect our purpose,&rdquo; cautioned Miss Katherine.
&ldquo;We cannot tell to what ends people might go if it
was discovered that there was a great treasure
concealed here. We will have to be careful about
admitting strangers to the house or garden. It is
very probable that some sailors, friends of Captain
Shannon&rsquo;s, might have suspected this, for I never
read a treasure story yet where someone didn&rsquo;t
make trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twice that night, after Miss Katherine had retired
to rest, she almost rose from her bed at the
thought that the house was in a most unfortified
state. Whether she expected to see John Silver,
wooden leg, urbanity and all, climbing in at the
window, I can not say, but she felt so insecure that
it was long after midnight when she fell asleep.
She dreamed that Captain Shannon and she were
sailing away to Cocos Island and he was telling her
that all the jewels there were hers if she would
only take him, too. Ah! the futility of the sweetest
dreams!</p>

<p>But the next day Miss Katherine had the treasure
searching problem well in hand. Her mind
had at once turned to the classic on this subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
and she hastened to find Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Purloined Letter&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Gold Bug.&rdquo; Therein she found many possible
methods and studied in detail the house-searching
methods of the Parisian commissaire de police.
She imparted something of what she had learned
to Joseph, but he didn&rsquo;t have any faith in &lsquo;yarns.&rsquo;
His fingers were itching to use the spade and pick-axe,
but this Miss Katherine strictly forbade as yet.</p>

<p>The next day she continued her studies and was
in a most interesting and instructive part when
the door bell rang. She knew that Mrs. White,
their only maid, was so employed that she could
not go to the door. Reluctantly she laid down her
book and answered the ring. A well-built, fresh,
clean shaven man of about sixty regarded Miss
Katherine pleasantly as he inquired if Mr. Boulby
were home. Upon being informed that Mr. Boulby
was not home, the stranger said that with permission
he would step in and explain his business.
The line of thought upon which Miss Katherine
had been intent for the past few days had inclined
her to be suspicious, and she regarded the stranger
with a distrustful eye. He, however, was
quite unobservant of this attitude toward himself,
and he stepped into the hall. Miss Katherine
was compelled to conduct him to the library, the
other rooms being in the throes of house-cleaning.
As the stranger entered that room his eye fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
immediately upon Captain Shannon&rsquo;s portrait
which occupied a very conspicuous place. He
seemed struck by it, and as Miss Katherine turned
to offer him a chair she saw him gazing at it with
great interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you observe Captain Shannon&rsquo;s portrait,&rdquo;
said Miss Katherine in a pleased voice. &ldquo;We have
just come here, but I am greatly interested in the
Captain. I found the portrait in a closet and
framed it. I think it is a remarkable face, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question seemed to confuse the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;do you?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I believe I
have met the Captain, oh, I mean I knew him
quite well. Now, er, well really what is remarkable
about the face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is so much remarkable about it, to me,&rdquo;
returned Miss Katherine. &ldquo;There is unusual
strength in every feature, it seems to me, and the
face is a most interesting and attractive one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger&rsquo;s hand crept to his face where it
went through the motions of clutching a beard,
an adornment which he lacked. He gazed stupidly
from the portrait to Miss Katherine and back
again to the portrait. He spoke in a very hesitating
and uncertain way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say&mdash;that you&mdash;er&mdash;found the portrait
in a closet&mdash;er&mdash;and went to the trouble of framing
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, that is quite correct. But it was no trouble,
only a pleasure and the contemplation of those
features has amply repaid me,&rdquo; replied Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;er&mdash;will naturally be very gratifying to&mdash;er&mdash;the
Captain&mdash;ah&mdash;when he returns&mdash;ah&mdash;to
find his portrait so&mdash;er&mdash;highly valued,&rdquo; observed
the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t say about that as the poor
Captain was drowned, at least he is supposed to
have been lost at sea. But I believe him to have
been a very modest man, and I doubt whether it
would really gratify him to see his portrait there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger&rsquo;s hand again went to his face, and
as it was a large hand almost covered the features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard,&rdquo; he began in a very throaty
voice, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know that the Captain&mdash;ah&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;what
you just said, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine observed the stranger sympathetically.
He had evidently been a friend of the
Captain and felt his loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, sir,&rdquo; she said kindly, &ldquo;I see you feel
this, and no wonder. Of course in cases like this
one is never sure just what has happened; but it
is believed that Captain Shannon must have met
with some misfortune as he has not been heard
from for seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! seven years!&rdquo; repeated the man. &ldquo;Ah, I
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is a pity that such a man as Captain Shannon
should be cut off in his prime,&rdquo; sighed Miss
Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you think that the late Captain was&mdash;er&mdash;a&mdash;ah&mdash;some
good in the world?&rdquo; inquired the
stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sure he was that and a most charming
man besides,&rdquo; replied Miss Katherine, her eyes
dwelling admiringly and wistfully on the portrait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Captain should be hap&mdash;ah, I mean&mdash;er&mdash;it
is pleasant&mdash;er&mdash;I should say, madam, that&mdash;ah&mdash;in
fact I am detaining you,&rdquo; he lucidly concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; returned Miss Katherine affably.
&ldquo;If you would explain your business I might serve
in place of my brother, or I can tell him you called,
Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;a&mdash;Murphy,&rdquo; supplied the stranger hastily.
&ldquo;I knew this place was for rent but didn&rsquo;t
know whether it had been taken or not so I
thought I&rsquo;d see about it. It would suit me splendidly.
Would you&mdash;ah&mdash;could you consider a
lodger, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; replied Miss Katherine very
pleasantly&mdash;the man was very gentlemanly and
not at all ordinary&mdash;&ldquo;really, I&rsquo;m afraid not, although
I should very much like to accommodate
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Mr. Murphy assured her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice healthy spot and I think I&rsquo;ll spend a
few months here&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;recover my health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine looked at his fresh face and vigorous
frame in some surprise, whereupon Mr.
Murphy made haste to explain:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am feeling very much better now, but not
quite right. I&mdash;ah&mdash;should be able to lift five
hundred pounds. Well now, I&rsquo;ll just say good
morning and I&rsquo;ll see if I can get suitable lodgings
somewhere near. I feel&mdash;er&mdash;that our common
friendship for the late Captain Shannon should
be&mdash;ah&mdash;a sort of bond, so to speak, between us,
so I shall drop in to see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine gave him a very cordial invitation
to come and see her brother and herself frequently.</p>

<p>When the door had closed upon Mr. Murphy, a
shade passed over her face and she betook herself
again to the library. Could it be that this stranger
was a spy? Had he really known the Captain
and suspected the existence of the treasure? Was
he going to stay in the vicinity to keep watch upon
them? Miss Katherine trembled as she thought
of what might have become of Joseph and herself
if she had taken him as a lodger. But here poor
Miss Katherine&rsquo;s heart suffered a pang, for she
thought of the gentlemanly deportment and attractive
appearance of her visitor. He had seemed
quite impressed with her, too. There was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
denying it. She rose from the chair with a sigh
and walked about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must hide the book, anyway,&rdquo; she exclaimed
aloud. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what that man was
after and I&rsquo;d better put it in a safe place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the treasured volume&mdash;Capt. Shannon&rsquo;s
diary&mdash;and, after glancing out of the window to
make sure she was not watched, she stole cautiously
from the room as if the house were full of
spies. When she reached the floor above she stood
still, wondering what hiding places the house afforded.
There were not many, she knew, but now
she could think of none. Downstairs was out of
the question. Anyone could come in there at night
and carry it off. The second floor was little better
for the windows were all open and anyone could
enter them by means of a ladder. The attic! Yes,
that was the only place and Miss Katherine flew up
the steep stairs to the attic.</p>

<p>There was a very little light admitted through a
small window, and when her eyes became accustomed
to the dim light, she saw a trap door in the
ceiling. Of all places in the world this was the
most desirable. As luck would have it she found
an old ladder among the rubbish. One end of this
she placed against the trap door, then, pushing
with all her might at the other end, she succeeded
in raising the door and liberating clouds of dust,
spiders, dead flies and cob-webs. Though half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
choked and blinded she proceeded to execute her
scheme. Placing an end of the ladder in the opening
she endeavored to make it secure from slipping.
Of its strength she was fairly satisfied, but
she could not feel confident of its equilibrium.
She did the best she could and then began the perilous
ascent. She held the book in one hand and
with the other clung fearfully to the rickety ladder.
She stood in need of another prehensile member
for the rungs of the ladder were worn smooth
as glass and every upward step was fraught with
danger. The ladder creaked ominously beneath a
weight that was far from trifling. However, she
made a steady progress, and when she had climbed
as far as she dared, she very cautiously reached
upward and placed the book upon the rafters. In
her relief at having placed the book in safety she
forgot caution and gave the ladder the excuse it
was looking for. She felt the ladder going and
frantically grabbed the side of the trap door. It
was well her arms were not slender ones for they
had to support her entire weight. The very ceiling
creaked. A severe fall was to be preferred to
bringing the roof down upon her, so she suddenly
let go her hold and came crashing down upon the
floor that quivered to receive its burden. But it
was only a moment before Miss Katherine was
sufficiently recovered to assure herself that, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
book was securely hidden nothing else was of consequence.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Katherine was bruised all over and
had considerable difficulty in hiding her physical
sufferings from Mrs. White, who was a native of
Ocean View, and therefore it would never do to
arouse her suspicions. When that lady asked Miss
Katherine how she got such a bruise on her arm,
she replied that her flesh bruised at a touch and
she must have struck it against something. But
when Mrs. White inadvertently touched Miss
Katherine upon quite another part of her body
and she flinched before she recollected caution,
the aforementioned lady began to wonder, and
when a woman begins to wonder she soon has
something to tell.</p>

<p>When Joseph returned his sister related all that
had occurred during his absence.</p>

<p>His evident uneasiness concerning Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s
motives was quite comforting. It is so
gloomy to be the only anxious one in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t set foot on the property if we forbid
him,&rdquo; said Joseph with a determined countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t do that, at least it wouldn&rsquo;t be
wise,&rdquo; remonstrated his sister gently. It was
soothing to her bruises to note Joseph&rsquo;s anxiety.
&ldquo;He is a perfect gentleman, a man we couldn&rsquo;t
treat rudely. He mightn&rsquo;t be spying at all and
then we&rsquo;d look ridiculous, or we might arouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
suspicions in him by over caution. Now my plan is
to let him call if he cares to, but never to leave
him alone and to watch all his movements very
carefully. He might unconsciously give us a clew
if he has any exact knowledge of the whereabouts
of the treasure. Now don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s the
wisest course to pursue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph had no wile in his makeup, so would
have preferred a pugilistic encounter at the gate,
as the best way of dealing with a spy, but his sister
was undeniably the leader in this affair, so he
agreed to remain passive while she matured her
plan.</p>

<p>It was well that they made their decision concerning
the stranger when they did for the next
day, in the afternoon, as Joseph was digging
among the flowers in the front garden, Mr. Murphy
appeared at the gate. Joseph&rsquo;s interest in his
work had driven all thoughts of treasure and
treasure seekers out of his mind. He supposed it
to be one of his neighbors and merely looked up
and nodded to the caller to enter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon neighbor,&rdquo; said Joseph with
what breath his unwonted exertions allowed him,
&ldquo;could you tell me whether it&rsquo;s too late to separate
these roots and transplant them? I think they&rsquo;re
too thick, but I don&rsquo;t want to spoil &rsquo;em for blossoming
this year. I think a piny is as pretty a
flower as grows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, now, I&rsquo;d think this was about the right
time to separate the roots, but you want to do it
right. Now, if you&rsquo;d just give me the spade I&rsquo;ll
show you how to handle it and not cut the roots
and I&rsquo;ll separate them, too,&rdquo; replied Joseph&rsquo;s neighbor,
throwing off his coat and seizing the spade.</p>

<p>Joseph stood by and watched for a few moments
and then trotted off to get himself a spade.
The two men spaded and puffed until all the peony
roots lay on the fresh earth. Then the work of
separation began. The supposed neighbor acted
as teacher and Joseph was an interested pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Katherine, as
she looked out of the window. &ldquo;Mr. Murphy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For almost the first time in her life she experienced
a pang of jealousy and pique. When she
had advocated tolerancy towards the suspect, it
must be confessed that Miss Katherine was influenced
by more than one consideration. She had
been inclined to think that if the stranger came
again, she would be the magnet and not the treasure.
And now here he was pottering around with
Joseph!</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t stay vexed long, for soon she thought
he might have been coming to see her and Joseph
in his stupid way had stopped him with questions
about his flowers. And then he very likely was
fond of flowers and gardening. All nice men were.
The Captain had been passionately fond of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
Finally Miss Katherine sallied out with her most
engaging countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have pressed Mr. Murphy into service,
Joseph?&rdquo; she asked brightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; returned Joseph. How did Kate know
this neighbor&rsquo;s name?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even introduced myself to your
brother, Miss Boulby,&rdquo; explained Mr. Murphy.
&ldquo;We have been working so hard I clear forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mentioned Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s calling, if you remember,&rdquo;
said Miss Katherine to her brother,
nudging him sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Murphy,&rdquo; repeated Joseph. He recollected
it all now, and being no actor, dared do
nothing but stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must come in to tea,&rdquo; said Miss Katherine
to Mr. Murphy, who accepted promptly.</p>

<p>When his sister became leader in this scene,
Joseph retired to the background and subsequently
to the back yard. Miss Katherine conducted her
guest to the library. Supper would soon be ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remind me somewhat of Captain Shannon,&rdquo;
remarked Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy looked rather startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that you are fond of gardening. I have
been told that it was a passion with the Captain,&rdquo;
explained Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard something like that, too, about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
Captain,&rdquo; returned Mr. Murphy, who seemed more
fluent than upon his first visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling to-day, Mr. Murphy?&rdquo; inquired
Miss Katherine kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feeling,&mdash;feeling?&rdquo; repeated her guest in a
puzzled way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Ocean View will completely restore
your health?&rdquo; explained Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah, yes!&rdquo; hastily began Mr. Murphy. &ldquo;To
tell you the truth I have been so hearty lately
that I forget I came here for my health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that lovely!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Katherine
delightedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;er&mdash;yes, it is,&rdquo; replied her guest helplessly.
He was unaccustomed to feminine effusiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;ah&mdash;really I find that Captain Shannon interests me.
Would you tell me something more
about him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Murphy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is some years since you knew
him?&rdquo; interrogated Miss Katherine, and, as her
guest made a rather unintelligible reply, she continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have gathered very little from others concerning
Captain Shannon, but I have deduced a
great deal. I don&rsquo;t think there is any class of
people so interesting as sailors, and especially
captains. They are daring, picturesque, romantic,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Murphy scratched his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
head as if he would make an inlet for these new
ideas.&mdash;&ldquo;Paul Jones, Long Tom and even Captain
Kidd were such captivating characters.&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
Murphy changed off to the other hand.&mdash;&ldquo;On this
account I was disposed to admire Captain Shannon,
and when I noticed the books he had read and
loved I admired him much more. I have always
told my brother that a man is charming in proportion
to his love of tales of daring and chivalry and
romance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the tide of Miss Katherine&rsquo;s eloquence
was interrupted by an eager gesture from her
listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Captain Shannon set such store by those
books, I believe I&rsquo;ll have a try at them,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine&rsquo;s face glowed. Here was a man!
She went to the shelves and read over the names.
Seeing Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s lips moving as if he were
committing them to memory she offered to make
a list for him. This was too great a kindness!
How much he would value it!</p>

<p>All this and more that followed on the same
lines raised Mr. Murphy to a great height in Miss
Katherine&rsquo;s estimation. Through strict vigilance
he succeeded in maintaining this exalted position.</p>



<p class="break">Though other matters might temporarily thrust
aside her central subject of interest, Miss Katherine
invariably returned to it. The morning after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s second visit she set to work in earnest
to obtain a clew to the hiding place of Captain
Shannon&rsquo;s treasure. Where was she to begin?
She was well informed on the subject of secret
drawers and closets and she knew that one was apt
to stumble upon them unawares. An inadvertent
touch upon a panel, the slightest pressure on some
bit of carving might expose the most cleverly concealed
hiding place.</p>

<p>For this reason Miss Katherine experienced
more or less uneasiness when Mrs. White was not
directly under her eye. She found excuses to follow
her about constantly, until that honest woman,
being of ordinary penetration, concluded that she
was not thought strictly trustworthy. As she
was a very sensible being she decided that
it was not unreasonable for Miss Boulby, an
entire stranger, to keep an eye on her. She had
heard of such substantials as butter, meat and
flour disappearing through the back door, through
the agency of the domestic, so she offered to
get a testimonial from the minister. Miss
Katherine saw her mistake at once and lied
glibly but not well. She explained that since coming
to that house she had been strangely timid and
didn&rsquo;t like to be alone, and if Mrs. White had noticed
her following her about it was for that reason
and no other. To give weight to her assertion,
she threw in a ghost or two that she had suspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
the house of harboring. Miss Katherine would
not have congratulated herself upon the success
of her explanation had she known that Mrs. White
was saying to herself that perhaps all that was
true and perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t, but it would be wise
for her to keep an eye on Miss Boulby.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine had not yet made a sufficiently
exhaustive study of Poe&rsquo;s Prose tales and was
thus employed in the library the next morning,
when, happening to glance up from her book, her
eyes fell upon the great fireplace that occupied
almost the entire end of the room. Miss Katherine
received an inspiration. She sat up, straight and
alert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a most likely place,&rdquo; she said aloud.</p>

<p>She went over to the fireplace, looked at it carefully
and began a careful examination of the old-fashioned
iron ornamentations. In the centre of
the mantle was a dog&rsquo;s head in gilded iron. She
pinched and pushed him, trying to find a spring in
his eyes, nose, ears or tail. He remained immovable,
however, as did everything else pertaining to
the mantle. But there was still hope. She lightly
tapped the brick walls for she had been reading
Poe&rsquo;s frightful tale of the black cat, and she had
learned that an unusual space in a wall could be detected
by a light rap upon it. Miss Katherine&rsquo;s ear
was not trained to this sort of divination, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
persevered, testing first a wall she was certain was
solid and then working on a suspected area.</p>

<p>Mrs. White had not forgotten her suspicions of
the previous day and was on the alert. She knew
Miss Boulby was in the library and when she
caught the sound of a gently repeated, mysterious
rapping in that room, she tiptoed to the door and
applied her eye to the keyhole. What she saw
would have made anyone inquire whether Miss
Boulby were in possession of her senses or if she
never had had any. She was down upon her knees
before the hearth, gently tapping the bricks and
listening intently to the sound she produced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My stars alive!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. White to herself
as she rose on trembling limbs, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s she
after or is she crazy? It&rsquo;s my belief she&rsquo;s stark
crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unable to satisfactorily answer her own query
she crept back to the kitchen, where she sat down
and faced the situation. Was she not in danger by
remaining there with a lunatic? She shivered
when she thought that she very likely had been
within an inch of death when Miss Boulby had
taken to following her around. Thank goodness,
she had taken to tearing the house to bits and not
her! Mrs. White resolved to have a bad attack of
sciatica that very night and to leave the next
morning. Meanwhile she would be constantly on
guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
All unsuspecting this attitude on Mrs. White&rsquo;s
part, Miss Katherine was preparing for bed that
night and thinking about the unfortunate impression
she had made upon Mrs. White.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a good and sensible woman,&rdquo; said Miss
Katherine to herself. &ldquo;I should be very sorry to
hurt her feelings or awaken any suspicions in
her, but&mdash;I declare to goodness I&rsquo;ve never
searched the cellar and that&rsquo;s one of the likeliest
places. I can&rsquo;t possibly do it in the daytime for
she goes there so frequently. I&rsquo;d just better slip
down now and have a look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Miss Katherine slipped a heavy wrapper
over her night dress, drew on her stockings
and slippers, and with the extreme caution that
makes every board in a floor creak and every joint
in one&rsquo;s body crack, she proceeded down the stairs.</p>

<p>Now this stealthy tread was just what Mrs.
White&rsquo;s ears was expecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s prowling round the house,&rdquo; whispered
that lady to herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy I didn&rsquo;t fall
asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having located the enemy, Mrs. White slipped
out in cautious pursuit. She heard Miss Katherine
enter into the kitchen and open the cellar
door and start down the stairs. She stole out the
front way and went round the house to a cellar
window. When she arrived at that vantage point
she beheld Miss Katherine standing in the centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
of the cellar, holding a lamp above her head that
she might first get a good general view before beginning
particular investigations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a difficult task,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;the
cellar is so large that it would take me all night
to sound all the walls. Now, would there be an
old iron-bound sea-chest, the kind sailors hide
things in, in a corner here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holding her lamp well above her head, she slowly
turned herself about that she might see every
corner.</p>

<p>Now it happened that old Tabby had just presented
the thankless household with a family of
kittens. She had thought that some straw that
lay in a corner of the cellar would be a soft, safe
bed for her babies, and as a broken window provided
ingress and egress for herself, she had taken
possession of the corner. Old Tabby&rsquo;s guard over
her family was most vigilant, but she had not
been disturbed until this strange figure made its
appearance in the centre of the cellar.</p>

<p>As Miss Katherine brought her light to bear
upon Tabby&rsquo;s corner, the watcher at the window,
who knew nothing of the family in the cellar, beheld
the lamp dashed to the ground and heard a
terrified but half-suppressed shriek and then flying
footsteps. She did not wait to see or hear
more but stole upstairs as fast as she could in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
panic, not knowing but that she might meet the
maniac on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be crazy, too, if I stay here any longer,&rdquo; she
said to herself. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m spared till morning I&rsquo;ll
get out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put all the movable furniture in her room
against the door, sent up a fervent prayer for protection
and got into bed, but not with the intention
of sleeping.</p>

<p>The next morning she informed Miss Boulby
that she was far from well, was all crippled with
sciatica and would have to leave. Her pale face
corroborated her words and reluctantly Miss Katherine
let her go.</p>



<p class="break">I should like now to turn the reader&rsquo;s attention
to our friend, Mr. Murphy. That gentleman had
found comfortable lodgings and seemed to be getting
much attached to Ocean View. By watching
rather closely one might suspect that he wished to
avoid the adults of Ocean View, excepting Mr. and
Miss Boulby. He called upon them pretty frequently.
The boys of the neighborhood found
his society very entertaining and followed in a
pack at his heels. He did not always welcome this
following, however, for he often put a book in his
pocket and rambled along the shore until he found
just the right spot where he could sit and read
undisturbed. He had taken to doing this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
immediately after his second call at the Boulbys&rsquo;. The
books he carried at first bore the mark of Ocean
View Public Library. But one afternoon when he
had found his favored spot, he drew from his pocket
a glistening new volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh darn it!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Murphy, as he
regarded the book, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d ever thought I&rsquo;d come
to this I suppose I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ve drowned myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leafed over the book and looked at the illustrations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t dull reading anyway. It might be
worse. They say Cooper was a clever man so I
guess it won&rsquo;t spoil my intellect to read &rsquo;em. But
it does beat all how tenants use things. To think
of those brand new books looking like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy turned to the first chapter and began
&ldquo;The Pilot.&rdquo; He became very much interested
therein and read on till the greyness of the page
told him that it was growing late. He closed the
book, put it in his pocket, stretched out his legs
and gazed across the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned if it isn&rsquo;t the best of any of &rsquo;em,
and I&rsquo;ve read upwards of two dozen now. Well,
I&rsquo;d never have believed it. You&rsquo;ll come to almost
anything in this world, that&rsquo;s my belief. But it
does take a woman to give you the push that starts
you down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meditated silently for sometime, but began
again to hold audible commune with himself. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
wonder if I&rsquo;ve got the correct picture in my head
of that knight of the waves hanging up in that
library? It would be a good pattern to model myself
after if the elements of all those high qualities
ain&rsquo;t in me already. By darn, that&rsquo;s it! They
are in me all the time, too, and I don&rsquo;t realize it.
They just need bringin&rsquo; to the surface, excavating
&rsquo;em so to speak. &lsquo;Daring&rsquo; was one of &rsquo;em&mdash;well, I
never was called a coward. &lsquo;Picturesque&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a hard one to come at. Now an Indian dressed up
in his war togs, or a Mexican or even a cowboy
would have some claim on that quality, but I&rsquo;ll be
darned what a plain, sober, God-fearing man can
do to be it and keep the respect of his mates. I&rsquo;m
doubtful of making that one. If I remember right
she claimed he was &lsquo;romantic.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Murphy
kicked the pebbles about and then resumed his
monologue. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be as hard to make that
one as the other one. I&rsquo;ve got half a dozen
to steer by in any one of the books I&rsquo;ve been pouring
down me. Let me see, though, she mentioned
two or three: Captain Kidd was among &rsquo;em, I remember.
I&rsquo;d hate to have to carry on my conscience
all he must have had on his, if that&rsquo;s necessary
to qualify. But I&rsquo;ve heard he wore stunning
whiskers and that&rsquo;s probably what took her
eye. I can&rsquo;t call the others to mind but I&rsquo;m bound
to hit on them soon if my eyes don&rsquo;t give out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lengthening shadows warned Mr. Murphy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
that it was past supper time, so he rose, stretched
himself and started homeward.</p>



<p class="break">All this time we have been ignoring Joseph, who
had again fallen into the even tenor of his way.
The vision of gold that had for a time disturbed
his tranquility had vanished almost as suddenly
as it had arisen. Such flights of imagination were
not for him and he was leading a life of perfect
content when a malicious sprite stumbled upon
him and marked him for her own.</p>

<p>Joseph and Willie Brown, a neighbor&rsquo;s boy, were
spading up the ground where he had decided to replant
his currant bushes. Mr. Murphy had been
sauntering about and had pulled a book out of his
pocket and departed when Joseph&rsquo;s unlucky spade
threw up something which, in hitting against a
stone, had given forth such a clear, ringing sound
that he stooped down and felt about in the fresh
earth. His fingers closed upon something cold,
flat and round. He rubbed it against his overalls
until a piece of gold milled like a coin came to view.
In a moment his mind had made the connection between
his sister&rsquo;s theories and his discovery. He
stood gazing at the piece of gold. &ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo;
he softly ejaculated.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered Willie. He had found
but a clew to the treasure. Where was the bulk
of it? Willie suspected something already.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
Joseph looked at the boy, then at the gold piece, and
then at the place where he had found it. I have
remarked before that there was no strategy in
Joseph&rsquo;s nature. He seized Willie by the arm and
marched him towards the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ground&rsquo;s too hard for currant bushes,&rdquo;
he said to the astonished boy. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t work
any more to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Willie felt he had no cause for complaint,
as Joseph gave him a whole day&rsquo;s pay and
Miss Katherine filled his pockets with cookies.</p>

<p>Brother and sister now held a consultation and
decided that they must be up and doing. Miss
Katherine believed that they were in imminent
danger of having their treasure looted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know boys,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all eyes and
ears. He saw what you found before you did and
he&rsquo;ll tell all the rest of the boys and they&rsquo;ll come
in the night and carry the whole thing away. I
think we&rsquo;d better not go out to that spot again
to-day for you can depend upon it, he&rsquo;s watching.
He&rsquo;ll forget about it by night and then we can
go out with the lantern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Willie Brown was like all other boys.
After being dismissed by Mr. Boulby he sat down
in the corner of a fence and thought. A light
broke in upon him after a few moments of silent
meditation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet yuh anything!&rdquo; he almost yelled, slapping
his leg, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>True to the terrible oath he had sworn, he was
off like a shot to rally the Faithful Band. It happened
that he met Mr. Murphy before any of the
Band.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were helping Mr. Boulby,&rdquo; said
Mr. Murphy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I was but&mdash;but&mdash;.&rdquo; Willie&rsquo;s pride in his
secret and mystery was his downfall. From that
moment he was an empty vessel in Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s
sight.</p>

<p>That night found the brother and sister plying
their spades in the garden. Their lantern was
burning dimly, but it gave sufficient light to show
the boys all they wished to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell yuh?&rdquo; whispered Willie to his
comrades of the Faithful Band. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t that beat
everything? And here it was all the time and we
didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the old Captain was a pirate,&rdquo; whispered
Ned Larkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet so, too,&rdquo; whispered another.</p>

<p>There is always somebody to throw cold water
on our most cherished theories, as Willie Brown
was soon to learn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t take that thing in your own
hands and examine it, you don&rsquo;t know what it
was, Willie,&rdquo; remarked Tom Parker. &ldquo;There is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
mystery here alright enough, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say
you&rsquo;re right, Willie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they were a safe distance away they besought
Tom to give them the benefit of his theory,
but he absolutely refused. There was no good, he
said, in his getting mixed up with it, for if he
wasn&rsquo;t mistaken there&rsquo;d be trouble about this
thing yet. Considerably sobered, the band dispersed.</p>

<p>The next day, though dejected and cast down,
Willie Brown again circulated the fiery cross
among his faithful followers, and did not even except
the skeptic. He was fated to again fall in
with Mr. Murphy, who had been doing some midnight
scouting himself and was therefore in both
glee and perplexity. By a few skillful questions
and tentative remarks, Mr. Murphy obtained all
the information he could desire.</p>

<p>The next day Joseph and his sister were feeling
pretty stiff and sore after the unaccustomed exposure
to the dew and cold. They decided not to
work that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better drag that big packing box over
the hole, Joseph,&rdquo; said Miss Katherine. &ldquo;Somebody
might fall in and break a leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Faithful Band appeared later than the previous
night. Mr. Murphy had dropped a hint
about the folly of undertaking certain kinds of expeditions
at any other time than midnight. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
saw the faint outlines of the box but nothing else.
At first they were discomfited and then elated.
Ned Larkins said that they must climb over the
fence into the garden and dig in the exact spot
where the box then was.</p>

<p>Tom Parker, the dissenter, being the oldest and
biggest, was appointed leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; declared he emphatically. &ldquo;I know
better than that. I&rsquo;ve got too much sense to meddle
with that. The biggest detective in New York
wouldn&rsquo;t dare go and leave his tracks around there.
Oh, no! they&rsquo;re too cute for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom, of course, meant to imply that he also
was &ldquo;too cute for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willie had taken one snub from Tom and he
was determined that should be the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a calf,&rdquo; was his polite reply to Tom as
he vaulted over the fence. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to foller
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all followed, even Tom Parker. They advanced
cautiously. Willie&rsquo;s temerity was moderating
and he waited for the rest to come up with
him. They advanced in a semicircle. As the wavering
line was within ten yards of the box that
object seemed to lift itself from the ground and
a deep groan arose as from the bowels of the earth.
Oh what a fright was that&mdash;my Faithful Banders!
In a moment the fence seemed alive with terrified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
and struggling boys. Mr. Murphy crawled out of
his cramped quarters and went home.</p>

<p>The boys had, of course, been properly sworn
to secrecy, but somehow, the next day an uneasy
feeling pervaded the village. No one seemed to
possess any definite information, but there were
rumors to the effect that there were peculiar folks
now in the neighborhood; people weren&rsquo;t really
safe and Mrs. White could tell a good deal if she
would. That lady had exercised a good deal of
prudence and had said very little about the Boulbys,
but the day after the boys&rsquo; adventure she
was credited with volumes.</p>

<p>It was not long before the strong minded mother
of a member of the Faithful Band had obtained
from him enough to warrant her sending to all the
matrons of the village a pressing invitation to tea
that afternoon. It was a formidable group that
foregathered that afternoon. The discoveries and
adventures of the Band were duly narrated and
embellished.</p>

<p>Out of the chaos of frightful tales that flourished
exceedingly and waxed more and more fearful,
one could have deduced the fact that the
Boulbys were nothing more or less than modern
Blue-Beards.</p>

<p>Well, their families had to be protected, and if
they told the men all they knew it would be all
over the country in no time, and for some reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
they didn&rsquo;t think that would be well. As far as
they could see the best thing to be done was for
them to investigate for themselves that very
night.</p>

<p>And so it was that for the third time the Boulbys
were to undergo a night attack.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine was not the sort of woman to
be caught sleeping. She had been unable to continue
the excavation, owing to a slight attack of
rheumatism. She felt uneasy about so vast a
treasure lying unguarded and begged Joseph to
make himself some sort of shelter in the garden
and keep watch during the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to keep awake all the time,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d hear any noise in your sleep and
it would do you good to sleep out in the fresh air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Joseph was not a fresh air enthusiast, and
the very idea of sleeping in the garden gave him
rheumatic twinges. However, Miss Katherine
was not to be balked. She took the faithful old
dog Bruno by the collar and led him to the garden
where she pointed out the box and explained his
duty to him. Bruno understood and consented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman has always one she can depend on,
if she has a dog,&rdquo; Miss Katherine cuttingly remarked
as she re-entered the house.</p>

<p>Just a word about Mr. Murphy before we proceed
with the night attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
He had been very busy all day, walking about
the village, chatting with the boys and gossiping
with the women. There might have been method
in his gossip, as he seemed to elicit just what he
desired. Towards evening he took a walk along
the shore and held communion with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d call it chivalrous to scare
them. But she&rsquo;d rate it pretty high if I kept
watch to come to the rescue of the besieged or the
besiegers, whichever needs help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Murphy has reached this satisfactory
conclusion we will leave him and return to follow
the female posse across the fields to the Boulbys&rsquo;
garden.</p>

<p>When the group of trembling females had
reached the garden fence they beheld the confirmation
of the boy&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>There was a whispered discussion of the advisability
of further investigation. The pros won
and the means to this end now stared them in
the face.</p>

<p>The picket fence had presented no difficulties to
the boys but it was a great obstacle to their mothers.
To climb it was impossible. The only other
way was to make a breach wide enough to admit a
portly form. One picket was gone and they began
loosening several on each side of the opening. It
was difficult to do this and prevent the loosening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
nails from screeching. The process was a very
slow one as such care had to be exercised.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bruno was quite cognizant of their
presence and with bristling hair and bared teeth
was crouching for an attack when further provocation
should be given.</p>

<p>The Boulbys had retired early, as neither was
feeling very well, but towards midnight Miss
Katherine awoke and began to think of poor old
Bruno. She thought she would get up and peek
out to see if he were all right.</p>

<p>The trespassers were making sure but slow progress
and were still hanging on the pickets with
their whole weight as Miss Katherine looked out
of the window. She was not at all alarmed. She
understood her own sex, her faithful dog and her
own resources.</p>

<p>The heaviest of the group had now been pressed
into service as weights on the loosening pickets
which suddenly surrendered with a frightful
wrenching sound. Simultaneously with this noise
there arose from the box a savage growl and a
great, black beast threw himself into the air like
an imprisoned spirit released from Hades. From
the window had come a sharp report and from the
opposite fence a yell that must have been emitted
from a savage throat.</p>

<p>At the too sudden surrender of the pickets four
heavy females were precipitated against their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
companions and the whole posse fell in an inextricable
mass upon the ground.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine let the burst paper bag flutter
to the ground as she hung upon the window curtain,
helpless with laughter.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy scudded away from behind the
fence ejaculating,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully for her! She doesn&rsquo;t need a protector.
It&rsquo;s no wonder she&rsquo;s set her heart on a romantic
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When morning came and they could speak more
calmly concerning their bruises the same females
were again met in conclave.</p>

<p>Some were for placing the matter in the hands
of the constable, but this did not meet with unanimous
approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old constable Wilson couldn&rsquo;t get up
enough courage to go there,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a shame to ask him,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;Everybody knows he isn&rsquo;t expected to look after
anything dangerous. Such a thing as this was
never heard of before in this neighborhood, so they
just put in old man Wilson for he could keep the
boys out of the orchards and &rsquo;tend pound and
that&rsquo;s about all there is to do in this neighborhood.
Now isn&rsquo;t there somebody that could handle them
Boulbys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan,&rdquo; began an earnest faced matron.
&ldquo;I think Mr. Horton&rsquo;s the man to see to this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
If he can&rsquo;t exhort the evil spirit to come out of
them Boulbys, nobody can. And he ain&rsquo;t afraid
of anything either. It&rsquo;s his duty, too, to look after
things like this, for we all know that the Evil One
has taken control of the Boulbys, body and soul.
But we won&rsquo;t have to do any urging to get Mr.
Horton to do his duty. Just last Sunday he said
in his sermon that the scent of the battle and the
battle cry was like perfume to his nostrils and
music in his ears, when he could wage war upon
the forces of evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good plan,&rdquo; agreed a sister in the
church. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right in saying he ain&rsquo;t afraid of
anything. His sermon last Sunday was a splendid
one. I thought he&rsquo;d break the old pulpit to pieces,
he was that earnest. He preached about Gideon
and Gideon always makes a good subject. Do you
remember that he said that when he felt he was
armed with the sword of the Lord and of Gideon
he could face ten thousand foes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was agreed that this fearless spirit would be
undaunted by this task and a committee was appointed
to place the matter before him.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton was a man, who, had he been of another
religious persuasion, would have made one
of Alva&rsquo;s fiercest bloodhounds. He was untiring
in his zeal for the cause he espoused. He knew not
mercy and he gave no quarter in the battle. And
so he listened with hardening face to the tale poured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
forth by the suffering females, the most faithful
of his flock. No need to urge him forward on
the path of duty. He gave his word that he would
go forth without delay to wrestle with the evil
spirit that possessed these unfortunate people.</p>

<p>And thus it was that Joseph caught sight of the
ministerial form stalking up the walk just as his
sister was concluding a recital of the events of the
night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The minister&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; he warned Miss
Katherine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him hear you laughing
about scaring those women&mdash;likely it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s
coming about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed his sister. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d pretty
soon tell him to mind his own business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grim and undaunted Mr. Horton stood upon the
verandah, awaiting admittance. Not even the
pleasant, welcoming smile upon Joseph&rsquo;s mild and
open countenance softened his austerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, no doubt,&rdquo; he said
to himself.</p>

<p>It was well that he had steeled his heart, for
Miss Katherine was at her pleasantest this morning,
and she was very charming in that mood. But
even she could not soften that heart of adamant.</p>

<p>When he had seated himself he calmly began
a searching scrutiny of the two faces before him.
Perhaps he was a student of natural history and
had learned that this was one way of taming wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
animals, and as he had come to cage the roaring
lion that walked up and down the world seeking
whom he could devour, it would be well to follow
approved methods.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton was not a man to hesitate when his
duty lay plain before him, so he informed the
brother and sister that he had come to inquire
after the welfare of their souls and to save them
if they felt themselves lost and guilty sinners condemned
to a fearful punishment.</p>

<p>Under this attack Joseph was more nettled than
his sister. Miss Katherine told herself that he
must be a religious fanatic and as they hadn&rsquo;t yet
attended church in Ocean View, he believed them
to be godless people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have every sympathy with religious enthusiasm,&rdquo;
she gently informed Mr. Horton, &ldquo;but, of
course, I don&rsquo;t feel as strongly on the subject as
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark confirmed his wolf theory and he
began to fear that he had to deal with the wiliest
of Satan&rsquo;s lieutenants. He thought he had better
strengthen himself by a word of prayer so informed
them that they must kneel with him.</p>

<p>Joseph&rsquo;s face grew dark, but Miss Katherine
imperatively motioned to him to be silent and
passive. Mr. Horton implored aid in the task he
had undertaken and begged that he might be the
instrument to bring these poor, lost, guilty souls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
to repentance. Under shelter of this storm of
words Miss Katherine whispered to her brother
that he must control himself and must not be violent.</p>

<p>When they rose from their knees, Mr. Horton
was breathless, so Miss Katherine had him at her
mercy. She politely asked him to excuse her
brother as he was not feeling well, at which Joseph
gratefully withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A guilty soul is a terrible thing, Miss Boulby,&rdquo;
said Mr. Horton mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it must be,&rdquo; she returned calmly,
&ldquo;but what is even worse is to have a mind that is
constantly imagining evil in others. Now, Mr.
Horton, the ladies of your church have quite ignored
us since we came, but I should be very much
pleased if Mrs. Horton and some of the prominent
ladies in the church would call and we can discuss
what I can do and where I can fit in in church
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Horton fairly shone with triumph. Here
was a repentant sinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is joy among&mdash;&rdquo; he began but that was
too much for Miss Katherine.</p>



<p class="break">About this time Mr. Murphy was giving the
pebbles on the shore the benefit of one of his
frequent monologues: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them taken
with it before,&rdquo; he informed himself, &ldquo;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
never so bad as she&rsquo;s got it. Treasure hunting
is like yellow fever. You&rsquo;ve got to let
it burn itself up. I should think her treasure
hunting fever would be about cured, but you
never can tell with a woman. Perhaps she&rsquo;s onto a
new place by this time. I hope she won&rsquo;t go tearing
the place down to see if there&rsquo;s a secret chamber
anywhere. I like her to enjoy herself, but
she&rsquo;s apt to get into trouble with Skinner if she
destroys much property. I&rsquo;ll have to think up
some way of satisfying her or she&rsquo;ll land in the
penitentiary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she&rsquo;s found any more qualities in
the old Cap&rsquo;s picture? I think the picture&rsquo;s got
all the strength when she&rsquo;s around, for darn me if
I ain&rsquo;t as weak as water when she goes talking
about him being the kind of man she admires!
For I know that there&rsquo;s just so many qualities
that I&rsquo;ll begin to dig up out of me or to plant in me.
But she might come to the end of the choicest
characteristics soon and give a feller time to cultivate
a few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain tugged at a large volume in his
pocket. He succeeded in tearing it out. The place
where he had been reading was marked by a slip
of paper upon which was a long list of books written
in a feminine hand. The name of the volume
Mr. Murphy was reading was the twenty-first on
the slip and was &lsquo;Treasure Island.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d ever had a villain like that Silver around
me I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ve strung him up. Such dilly-dallying
around makes me sick,&rdquo; commented the reader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Murphy, do you talk to yourself or
are you reading aloud? Your expression is wonderful
if you were reading,&rdquo; said the pleasant voice
of Miss Boulby who had quite innocently chosen
for her afternoon walk Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s usual direction.</p>

<p>That gentleman jumped to his feet in great
trepidation. What had he been saying?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;why&mdash;I believe I was reading aloud. I get
so interested in those books you were telling me
about&mdash;the ones the Captain read so much, you
know, that I read aloud before I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine seated herself and motioned to
Mr. Murphy to do the same. She picked up the
book which had fallen in the reader&rsquo;s surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treasure Island! That is a most delightful
book. I am so glad you enjoy it. I do think that
a man who can, as it were, live these adventures
with Stevenson&rsquo;s characters is as delightful and
interesting a person as,&mdash;as even old John Silver
himself,&rdquo; said Miss Katherine with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-hem,&rdquo; Mr. Murphy cleared his throat and
rubbed his chin. &ldquo;Do you like John Silver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s just fascinating, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; returned
Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Miss Boulby. Fascinating&rsquo;s the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
I was hunting for just before you came up. But
it&rsquo;s the subject of the book itself that fetches me.
I was always after hidden treasure, Captain
Kidd&rsquo;s and so on. I don&rsquo;t suppose you were ever
taken that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine looked at her questioner out of
the corner of her eye, but he was gazing abstractedly
over the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I must confess that I have been
rather interested in hidden treasures. But, of
course, I have never done any actual hunting as I
have never had any clues. But I should think it
would be very interesting. Did you mean that
you have actually sought a specific treasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; explained Mr. Murphy, &ldquo;at
least not till I came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine&rsquo;s eyes grew wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done any real diggin&rsquo; here yet,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;but I hope to begin soon. Now I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you for I&rsquo;d like a partner, one who
thinks as I do about it, you understand. It isn&rsquo;t
for the love of the money, you know, but the romance,
that&rsquo;s it, the romance. Now you know all
about Captain Kidd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve figured it out pretty well, and it&rsquo;s
my opinion that some of his hoard lies right along
this shore and not very far from here.&rdquo; Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
imagination was pretty well exhausted so
he stopped to recuperate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Along this shore and not far from here!&rdquo; exclaimed
Miss Katherine. &ldquo;Dear me! Who&rsquo;d have
thought it? But have you any maps or plans or
charts or whatever tells you where to look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s imagination had taken a new lease
on life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got them hidden carefully in my rooms,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;I have been comparing them with
the physiognomy of the shore here and I believe
with a little help on the subject which you can supply
I would be able to identify the spot to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should love to help you,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Katherine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; returned Mr. Murphy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
just now since you told me that you were interested
in treasure seeking that I have really enjoyed
thinking about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you had always been interested in
hidden treasures,&rdquo; Miss Katherine reminded him.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s face grew red. He hastened to
explain:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that the books that I&rsquo;ve been reading
under your direction have been so interesting that
I couldn&rsquo;t bear to stop reading and look for the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine beamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
&ldquo;We will search together,&rdquo; she said coyly.</p>

<p>As they were walking home together, Mr. Murphy
observed casually&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine who was a great friend of
Captain Shannon&rsquo;s told me once that the Captain
had produced a new species of rose and that he
had been awarded a gold medal by the American
Horticultural Society. The Captain told my friend
that he used to wear it on his chain but he lost it
while working in his garden here. Wasn&rsquo;t it a
pity? I don&rsquo;t suppose you have ever come across
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; returned Miss Katherine
composedly.</p>

<p>When she got home she went immediately to
the library and to the drawer that held the ancient
golden coin that Joseph had found. She took it
to the kitchen where she scraped and brushed it
well. Behold! there was the name of the American
Horticultural Society on one side and on the
other the inscription:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consequitur quodcunque petit!&rdquo;</p>



<p class="break">When Mr. Horton returned from his visit to the
Boulbys, he told his wife of the gratifying results
and of Miss Boulby&rsquo;s wish that she and other
church workers would call upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The brother was strangely moved,&rdquo; concluded
Mr. Horton, &ldquo;and the sister was greatly softened.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
Mrs. Horton and her friends did not delay calling
upon Miss Boulby. That lady has been walking
on air since the above-related conversation
with Mr. Murphy and was in a very sweet and
forgiving mood. She allowed her callers to talk
just as much as they pleased and on the subject
dearest to them. They discussed and re-discussed
every phase of church work. Miss Katherine professed
herself willing to make endless quilts for
the missionary box, pin-cushions for the bazaar,
socks for the Old Men&rsquo;s Home and cakes for the
sewing circle. The minister&rsquo;s wife was dazed by
such liberality and when Miss Katherine spoke of
the number of years her brother had been deacon
in their home church, and of her own activities in
every conceivable church society, the ladies felt
that a terrible injustice had been done this exemplary
brother and sister.</p>

<p>When Miss Katherine had seen that her words
fell on receptive ground she still mellowed that soil
by tempting refreshments after which she proposed
a walk in the garden. As Joseph was from
home she offered slips, roots and seeds without
number. At last she came to a rose tree which,
she judged, would do as well as any other and she
launched into the story of Captain Shannon&rsquo;s experiments
to produce a new species and final
triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We knew,&rdquo; said the unblushing Miss Katherine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
&ldquo;that he had been awarded a medal by the American
Horticultural Society. Mr. Murphy, who is
an old friend of the Captain&rsquo;s, told us he had lost
the medal in the garden, so we began looking for
it. Come with me and I&rsquo;ll show you where we
found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine did so, elaborating on the trouble
they had taken to discover it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is solid gold,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and we were afraid
that the boys might suspect what we were looking
for and come at night and hunt for it, so we
set Bruno to watch at night, but fortunately we
found it. Come in the house and I&rsquo;ll show it to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Miss Katherine watched her visitors go away
she said to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess that all I said this afternoon was not
strictly true, but there are times when a prudent
woman will deviate somewhat from the exact
truth.&rdquo;</p>



<p class="break">When Miss Katherine had bade Mr. Murphy
good afternoon, on the day of his startling disclosure
concerning Captain Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, the
aforementioned gentleman fell to chuckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a devil of a fix, but I&rsquo;ve saved the house
from destruction, that&rsquo;s sure. I&rsquo;ll trust her to
make peace with the neighbors and then I&rsquo;ll gradually
ease her off the Captain Kidd proposition and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
then there should be plain sailing. But Jehosaphat!
What about that chart? Well, I&rsquo;ll just
have to get some paper and a pencil and go back
to the shore and draw it, that&rsquo;s all. I can&rsquo;t lie
worth a darn. I&rsquo;ve got to get myself in a worse
mess every time instead of lying out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Mr. Murphy procured the paper and
pencil and retraced his steps to the shore where he
labored long and arduously, for he was neither an
artist nor a cartographer.</p>

<p>In a couple of days Mr. Murphy informed Miss
Katherine that he thought he had located the
right spot and that afternoon, they would begin
their search. Miss Katherine was to join him at
the spot where she had found him the day they
became partners in this affair. He would be laden
with the necessary tools. Miss Katherine asked
if she should bring a bag in case of success, but
Mr. Murphy said no, they were more apt to find
it if they acted as if they thought they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>At the appointed time and place the junction of
the forces was successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine and Mr. Murphy sat down side
by side to study the chart. The latter explained
that he had worn out the original and this was a
copy he had made. The chart fully came up to
Miss Katherine&rsquo;s idea of a chart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can see if you study it,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Murphy, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s this bit of shore that&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
meant. See where it juts out here by the pine
tree! Well, just look down the shore there and
you&rsquo;ll see the very spot. From there just follow
along and compare the chart with the shore. Line
for line, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that remarkable!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Katherine.
&ldquo;What a wonderful observer you must be
to have noticed the similarity! But wouldn&rsquo;t you
think there would be changes in the shore line
since the time this chart was made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see it&rsquo;s sheltered here,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Murphy. &ldquo;That makes a big difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh does it?&rdquo; cried Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; replied Mr. Murphy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now where is the treasure?&rdquo; asked Miss
Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the first place I&rsquo;d try is right in this little
hollow. We&rsquo;ll go right along to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy shouldered his spade, pick and axe
and directed Miss Katherine to the spot, a little
sandy hollow between two little sandy mounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must keep guard while I dig,&rdquo; said
Mr. Murphy. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to let others into
the secret you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Katherine was quite disappointed, for she
had anticipated watching the excavation sink
deeper and deeper until the spade suddenly struck
the iron lid of a box, and a king&rsquo;s ransom glowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
at their feet. But she realized the wisdom of this
request and uncomplainingly complied with it.</p>

<p>In silence and with inward protest Mr. Murphy
plied his spade until he was obliged to straighten
his aching back. He looked at his task mistress
entreatingly, but she was on guard and had no
eyes for the toiler. The poor man gazed about
him in distress. Would he fall from grace if he
took a little rest?</p>

<p>Fortunately for Mr. Murphy, at this moment,
Miss Katherine&rsquo;s eye fell upon the little lunch basket
she carried. A pang of remorse shot through
her heart as she turned and beheld her hero leaning
wearily upon his spade.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of lunch Mr. Murphy climbed
out of prison with such alacrity that Miss Katherine&rsquo;s
soft heart suffered another pang. But as
pity is akin to another, warmer and tendered passion
let us hope all was working for the highest
good of Miss Katherine and Mr. Murphy.</p>

<p>Whatever hopes of a prolonged rest that gentleman
had at first entertained were soon destroyed
by a word or two from his inexorable partner, and
again the gentle chuck, chuck as the spade struck
against the soft sand, was the only sound that
broke the silence.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine, though not watching the digger,
kept time with his steady spade and strained
her ear to catch a clink instead of a click. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
would announce the bursting of an old leather
bag or the striking upon an iron box. There it
would be! Gold! Gold glittering in the light after
years of darkness!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; broke in upon Miss Katherine&rsquo;s golden
dream.</p>

<p>In mild surprise she turned about and beheld
her erstwhile obedient partner hurl his spade
from him and scramble out of the deep hole he
had dug. Rebellion was written on his face, but
as he approached Miss Katherine there was something
much softer and infinitely agreeable to the
female eye in his expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it all!&rdquo; said Captain Peter Shannon,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s stop this foolishness and get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
